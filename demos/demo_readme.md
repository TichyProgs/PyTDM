two demo files:
* `barka.py` with the most sacred polish song
* `demo.py` another polish classic
* `demo_fr.py` the same thing as `demo.py` but in french

you can listen to the second example [here in this low quality video](https://youtu.be/bHWxwoAm0OE) courtesy of me.

Also for the 3rd example look [here](https://youtu.be/ti8CjUXVVpo)
